// The Native App API.

// Implement these functions and you've got a native app. These are called
// from the framework, which exposes the native JNI api which is a bit
// more complicated.

// This is defined in input/input_state.h.

// The first function to get called, just write strings to the two pointers.
// This might get called multiple times in some implementations, you must be able to handle that.
// The detected DP dimensions of the screen are set as dp_xres and dp_yres and you're free to change
// them if you have a fixed-size app that needs to stretch a little to fit.

// Otherwise, just return false.

// before this, although it may be called at any point in time afterwards (on any thread!)

// before process exit.
// The graphics context should still be active when calling this, as freeing
// of graphics resources happens here.
// Main thread.

// Called on app.onCreate and app.onDestroy (?). Tells the app to save/restore
// light state. If app was fully rebooted between these calls, it's okay if some minor
// state is lost (position in level) but the level currently playihg, or the song
// currently being edited, or whatever, should be restored properly. In this case,
// firstTime will be set so that appropriate action can be taken (or not taken when
// it's not set).
